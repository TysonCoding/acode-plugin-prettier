# acode-plugin-prettier

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.

This plugin can format code written in [Acode](https://acode.foxdebug.com) editor for Android.
